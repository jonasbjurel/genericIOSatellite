0) Make sure everything builds with the new directory structure, and make the build agnostic to the directory structure
1) (SW + FPGA) Improved robustness with per Satelite unique CRC algorithm to protect against wrong latching: Eg. CRC^ADDRESS[7:4]^ADDRESS[3:0], with "startMark" Identifying Address 0 - last in the chain (first sent out)
2) Improve naming of class methods - avoid to have class name references in the naming
3) Improve buffer size checking in helper function for pm report formatting
4) Comment the code - both library and FPGA
5) Make function parameters const where they should be
6) Make a FPGA build option for LVDS or 3.3V CMOS, create twi jdec files
7) Finish the PCB design
